To proceed with Minikube using the Docker driver as a non-root user, follow these steps:

1. Create a Non-Root User (if you don't have one):

	If you don't already have a non-root user, you can create one with the following command:

		adduser myuser
		usermod -ag sudo myuser
		
	replace myuser with your desired username.

2. Switch to the Non-Root User:

		su - myuser
		
3. Ensure Docker is set up for Non-Root Usage:

	Add your user to the docker group if you haven't done so:

		sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
		
	Then log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect, or use newgrp to update the group membership:

		newgrp docker
		
4. Start Minikube with Docker Driver and Multiple Nodes:

		minikube start --driver=docker --nodes=3

	If you must run Minikube as the root user, you can bypass the warning by using the --force flag:

		minikube start --driver=docker --nodes=3 --force
		
	However, running Minikube as root with the Docker driver is not recommended due to potential security risks. It's best to use a non-root user whenever possible.
